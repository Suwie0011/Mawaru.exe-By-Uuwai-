# Mawaru.exe-By-Uuwai-
☆ I was able to download the Mawaru.exe malware, I say this because uuwai (the creator of this malware) deleted it from his profile (I think I now understand what happened to Jpeg.exe) it is most possible that he also deleted his profile but I don't know. has confirmed yet

☆ When I went to download the malware, I got what is in the image. Luckily, I had it downloaded for a long time. Unfortunately, I was not able to download version 1.2. I forgot to mention that to run this malware, it requires NET.Framework.4.0
